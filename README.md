# Report on Java Development

## Introduction:

This report aims to document the development of a Java system to manage a programming bootcamp. The challenge was to model the necessary classes to represent the bootcamp, courses, mentorships, and developers, and implement functionalities such as developer registration, associating them with the courses and mentorships offered by the bootcamp.

To address the challenge, concepts of object-oriented programming, such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, were used to properly model the classes and ensure code modularity and maintainability.

## Methods:

The following classes were developed to represent the system entities:
- `Bootcamp`: Represents the programming bootcamp and has lists of courses, mentorships, and registered developers.
- `Course`: Represents a course offered by the bootcamp.
- `Mentorship`: Represents a mentorship offered by the bootcamp.
- `Dev`: Represents a developer participating in the bootcamp.

Additionally, the `BootcampService` class was implemented, providing methods to register developers in the bootcamp's courses and mentorships.

## Results:

The developed code was tested and yielded the expected results. It was possible to create instances of bootcamps, courses, mentorships, and developers, associate developers with courses and mentorships, and list the registered developers along with their associated mentorships.

## Conclusion:

The development of the Java system to manage a programming bootcamp was successful. Object-oriented programming concepts were effectively applied to model the system entities and implement the required functionalities. The developed code demonstrated modularity, flexibility, and ease of maintenance.

## Case Study:

As a case study, consider a scenario where a programming bootcamp is offering a Java course for beginners and an advanced Python mentorship. Interested developers enroll in the bootcamp and are associated with the Java course and the Python mentorship.

During the bootcamp, developers attend Java course classes and Python mentorship sessions, where they can receive personalized guidance from an experienced mentor. At the end of the bootcamp, developers acquire new knowledge and skills in both programming languages, enabling them to advance in their careers in the software development field.
